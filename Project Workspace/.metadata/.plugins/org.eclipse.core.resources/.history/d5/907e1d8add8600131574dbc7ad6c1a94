 * 
 * blanks = {{"happy", "sad", "lonely", "angry", "amused", "bored"},
 * 			 {"happy", "sad", "lonely", "angry", "amused", "bored"}};
 * 
 * Where the first array corresponds to a list of words which can be used
 * to fill in the first blank in the response template, and similarly the 
 * second array is a list of words that can be used to fill in the second
 * blank in the response template.
