Overdrive!!
Okay.

Possible ideas include:

I'M BATMAN (dial-a-superhero)

EMS respondent

Possible conversations include:
  -Nature of emergency?
 
 
-> Pick up on key words within a question (5Ws, etc.)

>Does the user input something unexpected?
Use a graph (with certain set responses), with ways to jump from one to the other


Code words?

Will use Scrum; making work schedules will be an asset, also, 2-week turnaround time and heavier model unnecessary for the length of its process.  Also, less structured.

First nail down layout (stuff to do for product backlog), then work on it in 2-day (or so) bursts
>Bryce will work on project layout


-Tree structure for conversations?


>Bryce will do the graphs
>E will do preliminary docs
>Yasha will do starting interfaces
>And B will do hour log and also some docs 

E:
Project description
SDLC

B:
Tasks
Hours (essentially, the WBS)
Meeting logs, etc.
Gantt chart
